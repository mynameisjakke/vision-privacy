## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Site Owner, I want to install a WordPress plugin that automatically registers my site with Vision Privacy, so that I can quickly set up privacy compliance without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WordPress_Plugin is activated, THE Vision_Privacy_System SHALL register the Client_Site with the Backend_API including domain, installed plugins, and detected forms
2. THE WordPress_Plugin SHALL inject the JavaScript_Widget script into all pages of the Client_Site
3. IF the registration fails, THEN THE WordPress_Plugin SHALL log the error and retry registration on the next page load
4. THE WordPress_Plugin SHALL store the site registration token locally for subsequent API communications
5. THE WordPress_Plugin SHALL validate the domain matches the registered domain before injecting the widget

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Site Visitor, I want to see a compliant cookie banner when I visit a WordPress site, so that I can make informed decisions about my privacy preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Site_Visitor loads a page on a Client_Site, THE JavaScript_Widget SHALL fetch the current cookie banner configuration from the Backend_API
2. THE JavaScript_Widget SHALL display the cookie banner according to GDPR/IMY compliance requirements
3. THE JavaScript_Widget SHALL provide clear options for accepting or declining different categories of cookies
4. WHILE the Site_Visitor has not made a consent choice, THE JavaScript_Widget SHALL block non-essential third-party scripts
5. THE JavaScript_Widget SHALL remember the visitor's consent choice for subsequent page visits on the same Client_Site

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Site Visitor, I want my cookie preferences to be respected across all pages of a website, so that my privacy choices are consistently enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHILE a valid consent exists, THE JavaScript_Widget SHALL enforce the visitor's cookie preferences without showing the banner
5. THE JavaScript_Widget SHALL allow visitors to modify their consent choices through a settings interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Site Owner, I want the system to automatically detect third-party scripts and cookies on my site, so that my privacy policy stays accurate without manual updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE JavaScript_Widget SHALL scan the Client_Site for third-party scripts, tracking pixels, and cookies

3. THE Backend_API SHALL generate per-site privacy content dynamically based on detected services from Client_Scan and plugin data
4. THE Backend_API SHALL log template version history and timestamps for audit purposes
5. WHERE future dashboard functionality is needed, THE Backend_API MAY expose endpoints for reporting use, but no user-facing UI is required in version 1

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be scalable and performant, so that it can handle 700+ WordPress sites without degrading user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend_API SHALL respond to widget requests within 200ms under normal load
